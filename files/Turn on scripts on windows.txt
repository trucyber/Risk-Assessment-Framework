Open Run Command/Console (Win + R)
Type: gpedit.msc (Group Policy Editor)
Browse to Local Computer Policy -> Computer Configuration -> Administrative Templates -> Windows Components -> Windows Powershell.
Enable "Turn on Script Execution"
Set the policy as needed. I set mine to "Allow all scripts".
