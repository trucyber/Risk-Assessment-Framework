# Cyber-threats and Vulnerability Information Analyzer (CyVIA)
The standard risk assessment framework usually requires the use of tools or frameworks to collect data, followed by manual evaluation by cyber defenders to assess risk severity and determine if action needs to be taken. In contrast, CyVIA introduces a fully automated process that covers the entire risk assessment workflow, from data gathering to analysis generation. It enables continuous risk monitoring and provides threat-centric analytics that can adapt to changing network configurations without being restricted by time or space limitations. The key advantages of CyVIA include:

* Identify network and service dependencies within cyber infrastructures. 
* Evaluate individual nodes and the infrastructure as a whole for risk, taking into account implemented security controls and the risk from internal and external adversaries.
* Identify vulnerabilities within the operating systems and running applications of network nodes, and provide information on associated consequences and mitigation strategies.
* Classify the vulnerabilities based on type of weakness, severity, and access vectors.
* Infrastructure-based top 10 most vulnerable products.
* Highlight products based on mean severity, vulnerability scores, and number of vulnerabilities.
* Identify high-priority vulnerabilities and weakness types that defenders should prioritize for remediation.
* Generate relational analyses between the found vulnerabilities, products, and weakness types.
* Monitor for anomalous user activities based on recent adversarial trends.

### Setup Instructions:
* Python libraries: os, glob, requests, re, zipfile, timeit, json, csv, spacy
* Graphviz should also be available in the path environment variables. 

### Screen shots in action:
The programming language used is Python and we have used CouchDB as the backend. We are constantly upgrading the code, parts of the tool may not be available because of the continuous upgrades. As soon as we have a fully tested part, it will be available and screen shots will be provided as well.

At first, we collect CWE data from MITRE.

Then, we collect detailed information on these CWEs.

Next we collect CVE Data from NVD Feeds.

After this, we parepare the CyVIA Knowledge-base.

# Quantitative Risk Modeling and Analysis for Large-Scale Cyber-Physical Systems
Threats of cyber attacks are very real today and greatly impact everything including the public health sector, economics, electric grids, internet of things (IoT), and national security. The number of new evolving threats and reported vulnerabilities has severely increased in the last few years. Perpetually refined cyber-attacks have set data, organizational assets, organizations, and individuals at considerable risk. Protecting sophisticated networks and interdependent systems, or reducing the impact of cyber-attacks has become a major challenge, where todayâ€™s effective countermeasures can be completely ineffective tomorrow. The various risk assessment frameworks and methodologies are either high-level, missing risk metrics values, not suitable for all kinds of networks, or publicly not available. To address this issue, we present a quantitative risk assessment model, that helps to model the organizational security posture, evaluates the security controls in place, and provides an understanding of the associated risks. We further provide a detailed explanation of the formulations and evaluate the proposed model on an industrial scenario.
